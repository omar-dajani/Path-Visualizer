# Path-Visualizer
### Welcome!
Thanks for taking the time to have a look at my project. This web application visualizes different pathfinding algorithms to allow you to see them in action! You can access the final build of the project here http://omardajani.com/projects/path-visualizer/

### Algorithms
* **Dijkstra:** a great, weighted algorithm for pathfinding. Always guarantees the shortest path!
* **Depth First Search (DFS):** a bad, unweighted algorithm for pathfinding. Does not guarantee the shortest path.
* **Breadth First Search (BFS):** a good, unweighted algorithm for pathfinding. Always guarantees the shortest path! Similar to Dijkstra's algorithm except the algorithm is unweighted.
* **A Star:** The best, weighted algorithm for pathfinding. Always guarantees the shortest path! Utilizes manhattan distance for heuristics which makes it much faster than Dijkstra's algorithm.
